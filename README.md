# Comparison-between-Min-Conflicts-and-Constraint-Weighting-Algorithms-for-the-Map-Coloring-Problem
In this report, we analyze two algorithms designed to solve CSPs (Constraint Satisfaction Prob- lems): the Min-Conflicts algorithm and the Constraint Weighting algorithm. We evaluate their performance on the classical map coloring problem
